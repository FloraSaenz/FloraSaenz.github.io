    <h2>Movies!</h2>

    <p>
        I was raised by a movie lover, my mother, and naturally her interest stuck to me and my brother. 
        I love movies and I will love movies until I am no more; I don't even care if they are objectively bad.
        Here is a tiny short film I did as a 30 second challenge. Further down you will find my top 10 movies
        of all time (up to my current age, that is).

        Definitely one of the better assignments I did while taking my film courses. I recorded this with a DSLR
        and loved every second of the process. It was a great challenge to fit a complete story into 30 seconds.
        The actress in this video is one of my best friends and my ex-roommate of three years, Ellen. She did 
        and amazing job bringing my vision to life.

            <h4>1. Everything Everywhere All At Once</h4>
            <p>
                I swear this movie made my frontal lobe start developing faster than it should have. No movie has moved me the way this did
                when I watched it for the first time in an EMPTY movie theater. I started crying about 30 minutes before the movie ended and 
                didn't stop sobbing until I was home...That all took about hour and a half because I still went to get dinner after. I couldn't
                 stop crying! It wasn't even necessarily sad just so very touching for me at that point of my life. I will remain a Waymond Wang sympathizer
                till the day I die. When this movie sweeped the Oscar's, I had no comments; it was absolutely deserved. Watch count? 8 times all in theaters

            <h4>2. The Nightmare Before Christmas</h4>
            <p>
                This is an unmovable rock in my life. I will never allow anybody to speak ill of TNBC. The first time I watched this movie I had just 
                come out of the shower at 6:00 a.m. to get ready for school and Disney Channel was on. I was hooked! After that, I kept begging the Cable T.V. Gods
                that they would transmit it one more time so I could watch the beginning...That did not happen. Instead, my mom surprised me with the D.V.D. as a 
                Christmas gift!  After that, we have been inseparable. Everything I see that has any of the characters on it, I will purchase. I excuse 
                overconsumption only when it comes to me. Watch count? 11 times on Christmas day and yearly after that

            <h4>3. The Lego Batman Movie</h4>
            <p>
                THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER! The writers were on a roll with this one. The characters are all so lovable and I love the specific humor of Lego movies. 
                Will Arnett is the best Batman voice and I take no criticism. I really like the amount of detail that inevitably must go into making and animating anything
                Lego. Just thinking about the plastic textures and the irregular surface for EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM...I need to sit down and reflect. What if I said this 
                was one of the best character developments to ever be put on cinemas? I would be correct. This movie is never, ever boring. Watch count? Every time I have had a big 
                assignment due.

            <h4>4. La La Land</h4>
            <p>
                Ruined my life in the best way possible. I have a funny story regarding this movie: I obsessively streamed the soundtrack long before the movie came out and lived off of the 
                movie trailer. When I watched the actual movie, I coulnd't help but feel disappointed and bored. To this day I don't know why that happened! On my second watch it was like 
                I had never watched it the first time because my perspective had completely changed! It was my top 2 movie for a long time (behind TNBC) but more movies came along with time. I have to 
                admit that I can only watch this movie if I mentalize myself so I have not seen it all that much. Watch count? 6 times

            <h4>5. 9</h4>
            <p>
                In all honesty, I had no business watching this when I was little. I remember the end making me super emotional as a child but there were a lot of themes that I did not understand 
                at all. I rewatched a fully cognitive human and I realized just how dark the movie actually was and how "adult" the images were. The post-apocalyptic factor of this movie on a world 
                where machines obliterated humanity after being fed too much information feels like it's hitting a little too close to home these days. I like the overall crudeness of the movie. Watch count? 
                Around 5 times

            <h4>6. Macario</h4>
            <p>
                During winter break of 2024, my mom and I watched a bunch of "Golden Cinema" movies from Mexico. Macario impacted me so much I immediately ran to Letterboxd and changed my top 4 movies to include it. 
                The film itself felt super ahead of its time of release and it leaned heavily into the magical realism genre. I enjoyed the semi-religious imagery and the blurring of the lines between what imagination 
                was and what the real-world was. I liked how it almost represented a rags-to-riches story but in the end, you realize that nothing you knew was true! Amazing movie and it was even nominated for an Oscar.
                Watch count? 2 times.

            <h4>7. Shrek 2</h4>
            <p>
                It's hard for a sequel to surpass its predecesor but I wholeheartedly believe that Shrek 2 accomplishes it flawlessly. I really like the seamless incorporation of a new world and characters to the original 
                story. The scarce musical numbers are flawless and don't even get me started on the I Need A Hero cover. I am always so thoroughly impressed by the untouched 
                cultural relevance of the first two Shrek movies, most franchises cannot say (or even refuse to say) much about their sequels. Dreamworks was so deep in their bag 
                during this era of the studio, I'm glad they kept that momentum. Watch count? Around 10 times give or take.

            <h4>8. Howl's Moving Castle</h4>
            <p>
                When I was in elementary, my Computing class professor was a huge Studio Ghibli fan and set every single wallpaper to a different Studio Ghibli movie screen capture. Mine was from Howl's Moving Castle and
                 it was the moment Sohpie meets Turnip Head. I felt so drawn to the Turnip Head character that I started doodling it on my notebooks. One time walking across a bookstore, I passed the movie section and saw the undeniable 
                 familiarity of Turnip's sillouhette on the front picture. Alas, the D.V.D. was purchased...And the movie was so much more than I would have ever expected. I loved it and to this day I still do! I hope Studio Ghibli never 
                ever closes down. Watch count? 7 times

            <h4>9. Mamma Mia!</h4>
            <p>
                In middle school, I was on a rendition of the Mamma Mia musical and I loved the story and the songs. Granted, I knew nothing about ABBA at the 
                time. I watched the movie with some of my friends at a sleep over and it was some of the most fun I had had watching a musical movie. Mamma Mia 
                is so unapologetically happy and chipper all the way through and even in its darker moments, there is an underlying feeling of love and light spread 
                across the screen. It's a great feel-good movie and a timeless take on the stage musical. Watch count? Every time I have an important assignment due

            <h4>10. Speed Racer</h4>
            <p>
                This here is THE anime live-action adapatation. It's the best of the best, it's corny in a specific way and SO. COLORFUL. I am not a huge fan of 
                race/ car movies but Speed Racer speaks to my soul. The VFX work done on this movie is unlike any other and the costume design is pristine. I love that 
                this movie's last concern is sticking to the way real-world physics work. It does not care and if they want the car to climb a mountain, it will. We lost 
                something special when movies stopped looking like this. Watch count? Every time I have been bored and 5 times with my brother.
